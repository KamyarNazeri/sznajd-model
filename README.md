# Effect of Social Media on Opinion Formation
In this simulation we investigate the effect of social media on the process of opinion formation in a human population. This effect is modeled as an external field in the dynamics of the two-dimensional *Sznajd model* with a probability 'p' for an agent to follow the social media. We investigate the evolution of magnetization, the distribution of decision time and the average relaxation time in the presence of the external field.
